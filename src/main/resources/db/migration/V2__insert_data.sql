All it takes is a few minutes and some new software updates released by Apple this week.</p><p><br></p><p>IOS 15.4 and iPadOS 15.4 updates pack a handful of notable features and security tweaks for your devices. Apple devices as old as the iPhone 6s (released in the fall of 2015) can run iOS 15.4, while most iPad models from late 2014 onward can install the corresponding iPadOS update.</p><p><br></p><p>These updates include long-awaited additions, such as the ability to unlock your iPhone with your face even while wearing a mask. Another new feature, Universal Control, lets you interact with your nearby iPad while you’re sitting at your desk with a Mac. And because words hardly seem like enough anymore, we now have a bevy of new emoji at our disposal.</p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(42, 42, 42);">Let’s be clear: Whether you plan to use any of the company’s new features or not, it’s worth keeping your devices’ software up to date to dodge potential security issues. Here are the some of the most useful features found in iOS and iPadOS 15.4, and what they mean for the way you use your devices.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Face ID now plays nice with masks</strong></h3><p>Considering that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/02/25/cdc-mask-guidance-changed-metrics/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(25, 85, 165);">mask mandates across many parts of the United States are being lifted</a>, Apple was perhaps a little late with this feature. Since we’re still in the midst of the pandemic, though, covid-cautious users can still get plenty of mileage out of it. (That is, if they’re using fairly new iPhones — this addition only works on the iPhone 12 series and newer.)</p><p>Even if you’ve set up Face ID ages ago, you’ll be asked to enroll your face in Face ID again once you’ve installed the update. Why? So your phone can get a better look at your eyes — as well as the space around them. If you opt into using Face ID while masked, Apple says the feature will attempt to “recognize the unique features around the eye area” to determine that you are, in fact, you.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you’ve made it through the setup process, Face ID should work as it does when you’re unmasked.</p><p>Still, these speedy unlocks can come at a cost. Apple admits that Face ID is most accurate when it can look at your whole face, so don’t be surprised if your phone occasionally flubs an unlock while you’re masked. That’s especially true if you wear hats such as toques and beanies that cover additional parts of your face, and sunglasses in particular are a no-go. (Regular glasses are fine, though.)</p><p>While these mask tweaks make Face ID less secure in some ways, it''s (thankfully) still not that easy to trick — you can''t, for example, point your phone''s front camera at a video of yourself wearing a mask and unlock it.</p><p><br></p><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>Interact with your iPad from your Mac</strong></h3><p>Universal Control, a feature that will let you control multiple Apple devices at once, might be the most anticipated addition in these updates.</p><p>Let''s say you''re working on a Mac and your iPad is propped up next to it — once both of them are running the latest software, you can move your mouse''s cursor between those screens to move files around or copy and paste text more easily.</p><p>The simplest way to get this kind of connection going is to connect the iPad to your Mac with a USB cable, though getting those devices talking to each other wireless is pretty straightforward. Just make sure both of them are signed into the same iCloud account and have Bluetooth, WiFi, and Handoff enabled.</p><p>The one catch? You’ll need some pretty recent hardware to pull this feat off. The full list of compatible devices&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212757" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(25, 85, 165);">is here,</a>&nbsp;but just know you’re out of luck if you bought your iPad before 2018 and your Mac earlier than the end of 2015.</p><p><br></p>', 10, 0, 0, true, '2022-03-16 11:38:07.441100 +00:00');

As worn by King Arthur (Sean Harris) and his queen (Kate Dickie), they come with built-in halos, which are attached to the back at ninety degrees, like the open lid of a tin can—handy for reminding your subjects that you rule by divine right. Students of Arthurian custom will also note Lowery’s take on the Round Table, which is more of a ring, with room in the middle for capering jesters, blackjack dealers, and the like. Watch this space.</p><p><br></p><p>Into Arthur’s hall, without an invitation, comes a figure on horseback—the Green Knight, played by the splendid Ralph Ineson, who starred with Dickie in “The Witch” (2015). Nothing but his voice, which makes a bass drum sound like a piccolo, tells us that this is Ineson, for his features are clad in rough bark; he is part tree, like an Ent in “The Lord of the Rings,” and he creaks as he moves. (In a film full of noises, which is worthy of savoring with your eyes shut, the most resonant is the steely, clattering hiss that greets the intruder when Arthur’s men draw their swords.) It is Christmas, wreathed with pagan ritual and Christian piety alike, and the Knight bears an axe and a branch of holly. He is armed with a festive wager, too: Who will strike him with a single swing of a blade, and then, a year and a day hence, accept a blow in return? As Arthur remarks, in a sinister whisper, “Remember, it is only a game.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Green Knight” is described onscreen, in suitably antiquated fonts, as “A Filmed Adaptation of the Chivalric Romance by Anonymous.” The romance in question is a long English poem, “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” which was most likely written in the late fourteenth century. The poet promises to tell his tale “as hit is stad and stoken / In stori stif and stronge”—or, as rendered by J. R. R. Tolkien, “as it is fixed and fettered / in story brave and bold.” If the language of the original, thorny with alliteration, has proved as tempting and as testing to modern translators—including the poets W. S. Merwin and Simon Armitage—as the challenge thrown down in Arthur’s court, how much tougher is the task of conveying, in a movie, even scraps of so distant a legend?</p><p><br></p><p>One option is to snap the whole thing awake. Thus, the sleeping Gawain (Dev Patel) gets a bucket of water tossed over him by his low-born lover, Essel (Alicia Vikander), whose accent wanders like a travelling minstrel. Somebody calls out to him, “You a knight yet?” “Not yet,” he says. “Better hurry up,” comes the reply. Here, we gather, is not Gawain the paragon of gallant virtues, as he is hymned in the poem, but Gawain the lad—lusty, hasty, and unsure of his noble vocation. Later, though, it is he who responds to the Green Knight’s dare; who decapitates him; who looks on as his victim calmly retrieves the head (which gives a defiant laugh) and departs; who is therefore honor-bound to embark on a quest, enduring many perils en route; and who, as the year dwindles, meets the woody stranger once again, and awaits the axe’s bite.</p><p><br></p><p>In short, the film is an uneasy blend of the bygone and the new. Gawain fulfills the demands of his Yuletide pledge, and, as in the poem, he takes refuge on his journey at a lonely castle, where the lord (Joel Edgerton) supplies a warm welcome and his wife (Vikander again, now with improved elocution) makes it warmer still, much to Gawain’s discomfort. Yet what we witness in his chamber is, if anything, less carnally candid than what we read on the page—“Hir brest bare bifore, and bihinde eke”—and the bloodshed, too, is diluted. The hunting scenes on which the poet lavishes great care, sparing no detail of gutting and butchering, are nowhere to be seen. (Lowery is a longtime vegan.) What we do have is a talking fox, imported from Lars von Trier’s no less arboreal “Antichrist” (2009), plus an introduction to Gawain’s mother (Sarita Choudhury), a sorceress of many charms, and a cameo appearance from a gang of passing giants. Above all, we get to hear the line “You’ll be my lady, and I’ll be your man,” which would have surprised Tolkien, one of the poem’s most distinguished editors, and which suggests that the culture of courtly love was au fait with the work of Celine Dion.</p><p><br></p><p>Yet “The Green Knight” wields a peculiar magic, the reason being that Lowery—as he showed in “A Ghost Story” (2017), which ranged with ease over centuries—is consumed by cinema’s capacity to measure and manipulate time. Observe the marvellous sequence in which Gawain, trussed up by bandits, lies on a forest floor. The camera pans around through three hundred and sixty degrees; finds him reduced to a skeleton; circles back in the opposite direction; and finally alights on him, now alive and about to break free of his bonds. What might happen and what does happen are thereby fused within one shot, and the fusion recurs toward the movie’s end, when Gawain, to his shame, flinches from the axe and runs away. As in a vision, we see him returning home, inheriting the crown, losing all joy, and watching his reign collapse. Such, we understand, is what would befall him were he to fail in his chivalric duty, and such is the irony that fires this film: it is when the director follows his own path that he finds himself on the overgrown track of the poet from long ago, whose name we shall never know.</p><p><br></p><p>Without wishing to point the finger at witchcraft, I’d say that the kinship between “The Green Knight” and “John and the Hole,” a new movie from the Spanish director Pascual Sisto, surpasses mere coincidence. Sisto picks up the spell that is cast by Lowery’s tale, verdant with danger, and continues to weave.</p>', 12, 0, 0, true, '2022-03-16 11:53:18.258252 +00:00');
